# Cerberus back-office

This part of the repository is dedicated to the administration back-office of Cerberus.

It is based on [MDB-Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) in it's Vue.JS version.

## How does it work

It is simply a front-end to manipulate the Cerberus API written in GoLang. To avoid requiring a separate web server, it is built and included directly in the reverse-proxy.
